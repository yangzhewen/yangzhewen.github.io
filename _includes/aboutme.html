      <h1>Hi! I am Zhewen, nice to meet you!</h1>
      <span><p>My name is Zhewen Yang (杨哲闻), I know it is hard to pronounce,
        so you can also call me Lucas. I was born in China, a beautiful country with amazing peoples.
        <br> I'm currently a graduate student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, located in Baltimore, MD.
        <br> Before coming to the United States, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Honors Science Program) from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China. During my gap year, I was fortunate enough to spend time at Nanjing University, where I worked on research projects in the State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/index.htm">Chen Tian</a>.
        <br>Now at JHU, I am also studying Computer Science major. Also, I'm pursuing my interests in computer systems, particularly in distributed systems and networking systems. And now I am conducting research under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/">Ryan Huang</a>. If you're interested in collaborating with me or have any exciting ideas, please don't hesitate to contact me via email!and participating research projects under the guidance of Prof. Ryan Huang.
        <br>Apart from my academic interests, I'm a passionate sports and POP Culture enthusiast. I love Star Wars (May the Force be with you) and I really enjoy watching football, basketball and baseball.
        I am a fan of OBJ (Odell Beckham jr.), ZO2 (Lonzo Ball) and Sho-time (Shohei Ohtani). And my favorite characters in Star Wars are Boba Fett those exciting bounty hunters.
        I love music (although I can not play a single instrument), my favorite artist is the one and only: the weeknd.
        <br>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. Let's connect and see how we can make the world a better place through technology and our shared interests!
